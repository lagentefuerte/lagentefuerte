# üëã Hi! I'm Martin (@lagentefuerte)

I am a student of Cybersecurity Engineering at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos. This repository gathers academic projects completed during my studies, focusing on cyber security, industrial networks, programming and forensic analysis.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: All projects are for educational purposes. They are not production-ready nor actively maintained. They serve as a portfolio to showcase skills acquired.

## üß© Academic Projects

### ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms
- **Practica-Algoritmos-IA**  
  Python implementations of decision algorithms like Minimax and A* applied in simple environments.

- **DAA** (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)  
  Solving classic algorithmic challenges, complexity analysis, and design techniques.

### üß± Programming and Data Structures
- **Estructura-De-Datos**  
  Implementations in C of lists, stacks, queues, trees, and other structures.

- **Programacion-Avanzada**  
  Exercises covering OOP, concurrency, design patterns, and error handling.

### üõ† Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking, and Forensics
- **Practicas-Tecnicas-Hacking**  
  Demonstrations of vulnerabilities like buffer overflow and Spectre/Meltdown attacks.

- **Practicas-Pentesting**  
  Scripts and pentesting exercises: scanning, basic exploitation, and automation.

- **Practica-Proteccion-Infrastructuras-Criticas**  
  Exploitation of Modbus (PIC) in industrial environments: proof of concepts and analysis.

- **Malware-Y-Amenazas-Dirigidas**  
  Advanced exploitation techniques with shellcode and ROP (Return-Oriented Programming).

- **Practicas-IS**  
  Work with SIEM, digital forensic analysis, and scripting for log/event automation.

### üóÉ Databases and Systems
- **Practica-2-SBD**  
  SQL injection challenges on vulnerable databases to learn attack vectors and mitigation.

- **Practica-De-Sistemas-De-Informacion**  
  Flask + SQLite app for phishing detection with data analysis and basic ML.

### üìö Other Technical Practices
- **EC-Practicas**  
  MIPS32 assembly programming with low-level routines and register manipulation.

### üéì Final Degree Project (TFG)
- **TFG - Malware Evasion Techniques**  
  Final year project addressing advanced malware evasion techniques, combining offensive and defensive cybersecurity approaches.  
  The project is divided into two main parts:  
  1. Development of a custom modular malware in C# with AMSI bypass, persistence, in-memory payload execution, and sandbox/VM evasion techniques.  
  2. Reverse engineering and static/dynamic analysis of the real-world AZORult malware to validate and compare techniques.  
  
  **Technologies:** C#, PowerShell, Python (Flask), VirtualBox, Kali Linux, analysis tools like ILSpy, JoeSandbox, and VirusTotal.  
  
  **Objectives:**  
  - Create a modular dropper and fileless PowerShell payload.  
  - Implement persistence via DLL hijacking and scheduled tasks.  
  - Execute advanced static and dynamic evasion techniques, including VM, sandbox, and debugger detection.  
  - Analyze AZORult malware‚Äôs credential theft and data exfiltration methods.  
  
  **Results:**  
  - Successful development and validation of evasive malware in a controlled lab environment.  
  - Detailed MITRE ATT&CK mapping of techniques used by both malwares.  
  - Contribution to understanding modern evasion techniques and mitigation strategies in security networks.
